# Survival-Project-ML-Agents
A project made by Sandu Zuza(ZuzeloApps)
This project was made for fun. You are free to use it however you want,
but I would appreciate if you will reference it.

To install the package in Unity click Assets > Import Package > Custom Package and choose the .unitypackage file. Import everything and you should be done!


All the action happens in the Chiklz script file

Have Fun!
